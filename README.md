This is a sample user interface written in the span of a few hours using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and jQuery UI.

To execute the code, either copy the directory structure to your web site or just run the simple python web server included.

Execute the inluded web server using the command:
    python ./httpserver.py

It will serve on localhost:8000.

I might flesh out this demo with line drawing to connect the tools in the content area, but who knows...

Enjoy!
